If you're looking for history, ruins, and the feeling that you are an archeologist in the 20th century, then definitely consider coming to Siem Reap to visit Angkor Wat. The mysterious morning mist, the overgrown trees taking over the ancient stones, and that one special moment when you find a spot in the temple with no other visitors; it all makes it worth visiting Angkor Wat. Most of the temples were built in the 12th century under the rule of King Jayavarman, but you will also find several temples that are dated even older. There are clear Hindu influences in the early temples with many depictions of gods such as Vishnu, Shiva, Rama and classical stories from the Ramayana and Mahabharat. Later temples are more Buddhist influenced with different architecture involving faces. 

The best time to visit is **November to early April** when the temperatures are not soaring high. Even visiting around Christmas time, the temperatures would reach 91 degrees Farenheit by noon, so planning your day is critical to avoid the heat from sapping your energy. Despite the heat, it is important to keep in mind the dress code while visiting the temples - **all shoulders and knees must be covered for both men and women**. 

### Tickets

If you landed the afternoon before your two full days, then pick up your tickets before 5 PM in order to avoid the hassle of getting tickets early in the morning before sunrise. The ticketing office is only 15 minutes away from Siem Reap city center. If you have to pick up tickets in the morning before sunrise, then plan to be at the office by 5 AM when it opens. Otherwise, you might find yourself spending the sunrise at the office or without a good view of the temple. 

There are three options for tickets: 1 day, 3 day, and 7 day passes. You can pay with cash or card. Online booking of tickets is not available. 

### Transportation

The most popular way to see Angkor Wat is by **tuk tuk**. You can talk to your hotel manager to set up a tuk tuk for an entire day to take you anywhere inside the complex as needed or you can try to negotiate by yourself. The prices were consistently quoted around $60 for an entire day. Negotiating a tuk tuk on your own can be difficult if the driver decides to charge you more in the morning for the sunrise when you aren't able to find any one else to take you. 

The other way to see Angkor Wat is to have a driver with a **4WD car** that can also be arranged through the hotel, which was quoted at $80/day with additional $15 to see Banteay Srei.   

Most drivers will ask for cash. Interestingly, Cambodians **prefer Riel or USD** for payment. However, if you choose to pay in USD, they only accept bills without any tears, ink marks, too many creases. Within the city, you can use the app **Grab**, which is similar to Uber, if you prefer to pay with card. 

### Temples: Day 1  

Today is the longer day of the two in order to cover the small circuit of Angkor Wat and see a few additional temples. Plan to wake up around 4 AM to prepare to reach the ticket office by 5 AM. Important things to pack regardless include handkerchief, water bottles, battery powered hand fan, and hat to fend off the heat. 

If you are interested in learning about Angkor Wat, finding a tour guide at the entrance of each of the temples is easy. The ticket checkers might ask you or guides might offer you their services themselves. If you are not interested in a guide, there is an app, Angkor Wat Smart Guide, that can be used even without data to explain the history behind each of the temples. 

#### Angkor Wat for Sunrise

As I walked with hundreds of other people across the moat in total darkness, I felt. As I found my place in front of the pond, I could barely make out the outline of the temple in front of me. The moon was just a sliver in the sky, giving off enough light to not trip over anything but otherwise not giving away anything until sunrise. By 5:30 AM, the place was packed with a small crowd around the pond. As the sky began to change colors, the number of clicks of photography also began to increase. Just drown them out, this is an incredible moment that we are all sharing together. From purple to pink to orange and finally, the sun peeks through. The temple finally appears in all its ancient, mysterious glory. I can see the pink lotuses blooming in the water in front of me. The early morning was completely worth it. 

After roaming the outer grounds of Angkor Wat until 7 AM, I decided to leave instead of entering Angkor Wat to make my way to the next famous temple. 

#### Bayon Temple

As we drove from Angkor Wat, we pass through the Southern Gate into Angkor Thom. 

Just how many smiling stone faces are at Bayon Temple?
