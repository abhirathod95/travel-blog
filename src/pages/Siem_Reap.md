If you're looking for history, ruins, and the feeling that you are an archeologist in the 20th century, then definitely consider coming to Siem Reap to visit Angkor Wat. The mysterious morning mist, the overgrown trees taking over the ancient stones, and that one special moment when you find a spot in the temple with no other visitors; it all makes it worth visiting Angkor Wat. 

The best time to visit is **November to early April** when the temperatures are not soaring high. Even visiting around Christmas time, the temperatures would reach 91 degrees Farenheit by noon, so planning your day is critical to avoid the heat from sapping your energy. 

### Tickets

### Transportation

The most popular way to see Angkor Wat is by tuk tuk. You can talk to your hotel manager to set up a tuk tuk for an entire day to take you anywhere inside the complex as needed or you can try to negotiate by yourself. 

The other way to see Angkor Wat is to have a driver with a 4WD car that can also be arranged through the hotel.
