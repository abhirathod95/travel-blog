Even though I've been living in Texas for almost my entire life, I was only now able to make it to the amazing one-of-a-kind festival in my neighboring state of New Mexico. Albuquerque's International Balloon Fiesta is a world reknown event that takes place in early October and attracts fans from all over the world! More than 600 different balloons take flight during this one week festival. If it's on your bucket list to ride a hot air balloon, then Albuquerque's the place to come.

#### **Transportation** 

The best way to get to the park is to avoid driving there by taking one of the many bus shuttles offered close by. The Fiesta crew was amazing this year in getting people in and out of the park as quickly as possible with more than 200 buses at their disposal. Taking the bus allows you to avoid all the traffic and parking hassle which can get very frustrating. In order to take advantage of this service, the **ticket is $5 per person** at each morning or evening session you attend. Assume getting to the park to take about **30 to 40 minutes** after parking your car at the drop off location.

There are four locations around Albuquerque where you can board the buses, so book your hotels close to one of these to save traveling time in the mornings! 

Buses begin around 4:30 AM for the Mass Ascension. I would suggest leaving by 5 AM on the bus. By getting there earlier, we had time to grab some warm breakfast burritos and find a good spot for watching the balloons take off at 6:40 AM.

Mass Ascension is the most important event of the Balloon Fiesta. Every morning, hundreds of hot air balloons decorate the sky like ornaments. In order to see the Mass Ascension at 7 AM, you should plan to be at the park for a good location by 6 AM. Buses begin by 4:30 AM for early birds. 

During Mass Ascension, you can also be in one of the hot air balloons yourself among the many balloons that take off. There are several companies that offer rides such as Rainbow Ryders and Sundance Balloons.

#### **Weather Tips**

Early October is the beginning of true fall in New Mexico, so the early mornings can be pretty chilly and windy. I would suggest dressing in layers to really feel comfortable throughout the day. By 11 AM, the weather warms up, and you're gonna want to peel off all those extra layers. 

In case of rain, there may be a chance that the events of the day may be cancelled since flying hot air balloons requires certain weather conditions to be safe. When booking a hot air balloon ride, try to avoid days with chance of rain to avoid disappointment. And book early!

The International Balloon Fiesta is one of the most photographed events in the world. Finding a good vantage point of the event can be difficult to decide on.
