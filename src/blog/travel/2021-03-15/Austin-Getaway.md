The Getaway cabin has become extremely popular with locations all across the US, and its easy to see why. The minimalistic decor with only the essentials and recommendations to lock our phones away to fully disconnect from our work lives and social demands was refreshing. The experience was well curated and thoughtful to the guests staying there, and also extremely accomodating of our dog. We were able to bring our Australian shepherd/border collie, Merlin, on our trip with us. Simply, our weekend getway to Austin, TX was just what we needed to reconnect with each other and to relax. 

The price for our cabin was $199/day for the weekend, and this seems to be the standard pricing year round when we went.

Upon arriving, we got settled into the cabin and busted out all our marinated meat and tortillas to cook over a campfire. There was a box outside each cabin with fresh firewood and firestarters to start a fire. If the supplies weren't stocked or if we had run out of them, there's a number provided so someone can drop more off within a quick 5-10 minutes. When we struggled with starting a fire on the second night, the woman also helped get our fire going as well.

The highlight of the night was getting to make and devour smores. All the ingredients and sticks to roast over the fire were ready to go in the cabin as well, and we didn't need to bring anything!

Everything you could want was provided in the cabin. The bathroom was stocked with fresh smelling shampoo, conditioner, and body wash as well as toilet paper. The kitchen has several pots, pans, cups, and utensils to utilize as well. Merlin even had a water bowl and doggie smores waiting for him.

We had two lazy morning with leftovers for breakfast and cup of coffee with the pour over bags given to us. We stored everything in the small refrigerator and heated our food up on the convection stove with a pan. The pickled onions, cotija cheese, and fresh cilantro in a warm toasted tortilla and smoky fajita chicken was so delicious and easy to prepare.

In the middle of April, the temperatures had already started to soar with the strong Texas sun in the middle of the day. We opted to retire into our small cabin listening to the radio, reading a book, or playing games. There were some great books and a deck of cards tucked away on a shelf that we went spent time going through.

When the heat began to calm down, we took short hikes around the area to explore the rocky terrain. There are also breweries and other hikes nearby that we could have driven to as well. All the nearby points of interest are provided on a map.

If you're looking for an easy, quick, and affordable trip to relax in nature, I would say it's a no brainer to look for a Getaway cabin near you. We loved our short stay here and are planning to try out different locations such as the one near Dallas.
