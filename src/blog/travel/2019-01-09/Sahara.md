The roadtrip to the Sahara was a bucket list experience I was excited to do. Camping was quite unlike anything I've done before, and I got to see a lot of Morrocco from the most touristy of places, such as Ait Ben Haddou, to more real life Moroccan villages during the drive. We passed through a variety of environments from snowy mountains to towering sand dunes. While the drive to the desert took almost two days from Marrakesh to get there, the many small stops we made made the time move by fast. After spending our night in the Sahara, we were in Fes by the end of the day after 10 hours of driving. While the four day tour is more popular, we were interested in spending less of our days in travel if possible. To the best of my knowledge, the stop we missed was seeing the wild monkeys and waterfall, which we were okay with.

Col du Tichka is the highest point of the Atlas Mountain that we passed by during our trip.

Our first stop after leaving Marrakesh at 8 AM was for lunch and a quick stop at Ait Ben Haddou. It's the oldest kasbah in Morocco and served as a trading post and safe place to spend the night for traveling caravans in the past. Now it is a UNESCO World Heritage site where several famous films have been shot.  

##### **Dades Gorge**

The Todra Gorge is a short stop lots of tourists make on the way to Merzouga. The gorge was very windy and cold that it felt like we were finally seeing some winter in Morocco. While we walked around, we saw many Bedouin people either selling their wares or asking for money to take photos with or of them. However, my favorite was seeing the donkeys drinking from the fresh stream passing through the gorge. I had seen many times during my drive through several towns that primarily donkeys were used for carrying huge loads. Our driver told us that the weight placed on their backs was sometimes even 4 times their own weight. So impressive for such a small gentle looking animal. 

##### **Ancient Waterways - Qanats**

Visiting the qanats was one of the more educational stops we made.

### <center> **Camping in the Sahara**</center>

All I could think of seeing the Sahara desert was how vast it was. The camels dropped us off at a convenient location to watch the red sun set behind the tall orange sand dunes before heading to our camp.

If you think you're going to be prepared for the night, think again. There were so many aspects of my night in the Sahara that left me unexpectedly amazed but also wishing I had been more prepared.

After dinner with our fellow campers, we all spent quite a while standing together in awe of the sight. Then, the campsite had arranged night of listening to Berber men play the drums and sing local songs around a warm campfire. Spending the night in a tent with no heater in the Sahara desert in December was an experience to say the least. BE PREPARED and pack lots of warm layers to sleep in. The campsite also provides four thick blankets to sleep with. I pretty much felt like a sardine packed under all those heavy blankets and warm clothes, and I found it hard to fall asleep being stuck in one position under the weight of it all. And somehow I was still cold. Whatever you think you might need to stay warm, double it. 

The campsite I stayed in had a working toilet and plenty of toilet paper, so bringing toilet paper was not necessary. However, other campsites might be different. There was also a shower, but the water was freezing cold. I also had access to one working outlet, but I still recommend bringing a power bank to use. 

Sunrise in the winter was at 8:15 AM. If you want to have an awesome experience on top of a tall sand dune with an unfettered view of the desert and the sunrise, the hike will take about 45 minutes if your campsite is near the edge. Don't forget to take some water!

Arriving back at the camp, there was a hot delicious breakfast with a full spread of crepes, eggs, fruit, and coffee! Honestly, the food we had for both dinner and breakfast was some of the best we had all trip, so we were really appreciative of the help working at our campsite. After getting back onto our new camel friends who had spent the night outside our tents, we headed back to the car to meet our driver by 10 AM to go to Fes.
