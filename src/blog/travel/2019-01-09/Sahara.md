The roadtrip to the Sahara is a must while visiting Morocco. The experience is quite unlike anything I've done before, and I got to see a lot of Morrocco from the most touristy of places, such as Ait Ben Haddou, to more real life Moroccan villages. We passed through a variety of environments from snowy mountains to towering sand dunes.

It's the oldest kasbah in Morocco and served as a trading post and safe place to spend the night for traveling caravans in the past. Now it is a UNESCO World Heritage site where several famous films have been shot.

### <center> **Camping in the Sahara**</center>

The second I arrived at the edge of the Sahara in Merzouga, I placed on top of camel to take me into the desert and watch the sunset. Riding a camel is not as hard as it might look, but they do make a lot of strange noises and slobber a lot. 

If you think you're going to be prepared for the night, think again. There were so many aspects of my night in the Sahara that left me unexpectedly amazed but also wishing I had been more prepared.

To me, seeing the millions of stars and being able to faintly make out the Milky way in the night sky was incredible and stole the spotlight. After dinner with our fellow campers, we all spent quite a while standing together in awe of the sight. Then, the campsite had arranged night of listening to Berber men play the drums and sing local songs around a warm campfire. 

Spending the night in a tent with no heater in the Sahara desert in December was an experience to say the least. BE PREPARED and pack lots of warm layers to sleep in. The campsite also provides four thick blankets to sleep with. I pretty much felt like a sardine packed under all those heavy blankets and warm clothes, and I found it hard to fall asleep being stuck in one position under the weight of it all. And somehow I was still cold. Whatever you think you might need to stay warm, double it.

The campsite I stayed in had a working toilet, so bringing toilet paper was not necessary. However, some campsites might be different. There was also a shower, but the water was freezing cold. I also had access to one working outlet, but I still recommend bringing a power bank to use. 

Sunrise in the winter was at 8:15 AM. If you want to have an awesome experience on top of a tall sand dune with an unfettered view of the desert and the sunrise, the hike will take about 45 minutes if your campsite is near the edge. Don't forget to take some water!

Either way you decide, the trip is going to be awesome. I picked tour, but looking back I think I would have preferred doing it on our own. The roads are easy to drive on, and directions are not at all difficult to follow.
