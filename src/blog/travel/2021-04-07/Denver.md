After more than a year break from all travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I finally ventured out of the comfort of my home to start re-engaging with the world outside with a short trip to Denver, Colorado that was booked only two days in advance! Ash and I were ready to celebrate our last few months before starting residency with an easy breezy itinerary that we made up as we went. Definitely something new for me, but still loads of fun! 

During this trip, I wore a mask and actively socially distanced as per CDC guidelines throughout the trip. The recent CDC guidelines stating that travel was safe for fully vaccinated individuals helped me feel more confident about getting back out there. It is important to be aware of the state's policies regarding COVID-19 precautions and respecting them for the safety of everyone.

#### **DAY 1**

##### **Brunch at Denver Biscuit Company**

After landing from our early 6:30 AM flight, we were hungry for some delicious brunch food. Denver Biscuit Company, also known as DBC, is a classic brunch spot to stop at when in Denver, especially since buttermilk biscuits is one of my staple breakfast food whenever I eat out. We tried the French toast and The Franklin with the mushroom gravy. Yum! The sandwich was massive and so so good! 

##### **LoDo in the Daytime**

LoDo is a popular area in Denver packed with great restaturants and stores to explore. At the heart of it all is the Union Station, the main transportation hub of Denver where you can find trains to the airport. It was a great spot to start our trip and explore the boutiques inside.

Be sure to stop at the Capitol Building and the Coors if you have more time in this area than we did!

##### **Afternoon Delight at Little Man Ice Cream**

We were still stuffed from indulging at brunch, but we couldn't pass up the chance to get some ice cream at Little Man. The line was short and the weather was warm, perfect for ice cream eating.

##### **Dairy Block & Larimer Square in the Evening**

Close to Union Station was the Dairy Block and Larimer Square with small boutique shops and many delicious restaurants to grab a bite. We were able to park our car in one spot and walk to all these locations. There are a lot of cool art installations and picture spots to enjoy.

#### **DAY 2**

##### **Red Rocks Amphitheatre**

We started our day visiting Red Rocks Amphitheatre which is an amazing concert venue surrounded by interesting rock formations. At the time, we were visiting, there were no concerts scheduled but would have been a great way to experience the place. However, there were still all kinds of people enjoying the open air venue, sitting in the bleachers, and having conversations.

##### **Explore Boulder**

Before heading north to Estes Park, we stopped in Boulder for a few hours. The Dushanbe Teahouse is a one of a kind building and a great place to stop for  an early lunch. Next door was a small art museum we perused through while waiting for a table to open up. Once we were seated, there was a long menu of different teas to choose from, and the waiter offered assistance with picking the best tea for us.

Afterwards, we walked into the central part of town to explore and came across a large bookstore. I am a sucker for a good bookstore, and this one was perfect to get lost in for a couple of hours.


##### **Scenic Drive to Estes Park**

The drive from Boulder to Estes Park was about 2 hours going the scenic route, but the views outside were amazing. We jammed to songs while driving and stopped along the way for pictures. During the ride, we lost data connection at times so I would be sure to download your map and songs before starting the drive.

#### **DAY 3**

##### **Rocky Mountain National Park**

Finally, we made it to Rocky Mountain National Park. Even though temperatures were already soaring in our own state, there was a full on snow flurry visiting the higher spots of the park. We hiked to Bear Lake and walked around for a bit before we started to lose all feeling in our fingers and toes. During our drive, we had to stop and wait for deer crossing. Don't forget to stop by the visitor center to grab a little souvenir as remembrance of the trip!

##### **Enjoy the Charm of Estes Park**

Estes Park was a cute town with a main street lined with small souvenir shops to browse through. For lunch, we stopped at a family run Nepalese restaurant for warm momos and curry to warm up after a cold morning in the Rockies.

One of the most famous activities to do while in Estes Park is to the tour of Stanley Hotel where Steven King came up with the entire plot for The Shining. As two horror movie fans, we knew taking the tour of the hotel was a must. Unfortunately, due to how popular the night tour is, we were only able to take the day tour which heavily focuses on the history and architecture of the building with just some of the spooky sprinkled in. However, it was just enough for us to satisfy our ghoulish interest and even spook ourselves out a little bit on the way back to the hotel in the dark!

I would try to book tickets as soon as possible if you know you're going on this tour.

For an impromptu trip, we had a blast and got to explore a lot more than we expected. If you're looking for a quick weekend getaway to explore a new city, I highly recommend considering Denver for your next trip!
