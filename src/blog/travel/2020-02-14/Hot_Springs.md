Hot Springs, Arkansas is home to the smallest national park in the United States. Just a four and a half drive away from Dallas to do some hiking and get some fresh air. I went with some friends and rented a cabin near Lake Hamilton for some barbeque and late night smores fun to go with the hiking fun. 

The best time to visit the Hot Springs is in the fall when the change to fall colors is beautiful and tick season is nearing an end. The weather is still warm enough to enjoy outdoor activities, but not the summer heat. However, we made the February a fun time to go by turning up the fire indoors and watching movies.

### **Things to Do**

##### **Hiking in Hot Springs**

**Goat Rock Trail** was an hour and a half long hike that ended with a bird's eye veiw of the national park and part of the town. We saw wild deer on our way back to the car.

Admission to climb to the top of the tower was $8 with a small gift store at the bottom. 

##### **Bathhouse Row**

Hot Springs is famous for the Bathhouse Row that used to attract people from all over to experience a bath with possible healing qualities. Each bathhouse is decorated differently but creates an opulent atmosphere. The history of this place is quite interesting, especially to someone going into the medical field. People with all sorts of ailments would end up in Hot Springs hoping for their sickness to be washed away. Today, the only two bathhouses you can still get spa treatments at are the Buckstaff and Quapaw.

Of all the bathhouses, the Fordyce Bathhouse is the only one that still houses its original interior design to showcase how it used to function in the past.

##### **Shopping the Main Street**

The best place to park to visit town center and the bath house row is at the Public parking garage on Exchange street which is free.


##### **Anthony Chapel at Garvan Woodland Gardens**

Just fifteen minutes away from Lake Hamilton, the Anthony Chapel is a popular wedding spot. The architecture of the chapel is stunning with clear inspiration from the nature surrounding it.

```
While visiting the chapel is free, the entrance to the Garvan gardens costs $15/person. There are several interesting sites to visit in the gardens like the Treehouse, but we decided it was time to head back home. 

### **Places to Eat**

##### **Superior Bathhouse Brewery**

My favorite part of spending time in the city was visiting the Superior Bathhouse Brewery which makes their beer using the 143 degree hot springs water. They proudly advertise being the only brewery in the world that uses hot spring water in teh brewing process. Even though we didn't really notice a difference in the taste of the beer from other craft beer we've had before, it was fun trying all the different flavors offered at the brewery with a whopping 18 flight Beer Bath. The appetizer of shishito peppers was also to die for! Before we left, we signed our initials into the flight carrier for finishing all 18 flights!

##### **The Pancake House**

##### **Hale Bathhouse Restaurant**

As we were walking the Bathhouse Row, the sign in front of the Hale Bathhouse advertising their soup of the day, Portuguese Wedding soup, caught our eye. Even though I've been to Portugal, I was not familiar with this soup, and we just had to taste it! The fact that there were three dollar mimosas just sweetened the deal. This bathhouse also serves as a hotel that guests can stay at. 

##### **Fat Bottomed Girls Cupcakes**

The owners of this bakery were once featured on Food Network. We tried the Churro and Lemon Lavender flavored cupcakes. Needless to say, their cupcakes were delicious and well worth the extra calories. 

##### **Delucas Pizza**



### **Where We Stayed**

We stayed at **Five Points Cabins** in one of the new three bedroom cabins. The place was perfect for a short cabin getaway with an awesome owner who spent twenty minutes going over all the things to do nearby and stocked our fridge with breakfast goodies. Staying near Lake Hamilton can be a lot of fun, especially in the summer, when there all sorts of lake activities to do. The location is only 20 minutes away from the town center, making it convenient to enjoy both.

Other popular places to stay are located within the center of Hot Springs with nearby access to the main street and the national park. The **Arlington Hotel** was the first hotel to be built in Hot Springs and still provides lodging today. The **Waters Hotel** is another popular hotel to book a comfortable stay while in Hot Springs.
