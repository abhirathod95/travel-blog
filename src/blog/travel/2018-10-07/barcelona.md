My trip to Barcelona was inspired by the late Antoni Gaudi and his remarkable architecture. During my freshman year of college, I was lucky enough to take a very popular class called Architecture and Society lead by Professor Speck. He was so invested to make students who didn’t know much about architecture understand how architecture can really influence everyone’s lives. One of the main architects we learned about was Gaudi and his attention to form. Gaudi was known for emphasizing the natural aspects of Spain that he saw around him in his work. When I had the chance to go to Europe, I simply had to see Barcelona and Gaudi’s architecture for myself. The trip did not disappoint! Barcelona was like a dream that I leisurely spent enjoying the sights, eating tapas, and walking the Spanish streets.  
#### **Basilica de la Sagrada Familia**

La Sagrada Familia is probably the most important site in Barcelona and for good reason. The high vault ceilings, unique colorful stained-glass windows, and the dramatic embellishments on the exterior are unlike any church architecture I’ve seen before. Finding the Sagrada Familia is not difficult; it towers over most of the buildings in Barcelona. As I walked up to the church, I was surprised by all the detail surrounding every inch around the door and towers. After minutes of standing there trying to piece together the details, I could say one thing already; there was incredible care and passion invested in this building. Gaudi was one of the major architects in the project, but he was not the only one since he died during the middle of the church’s construction. His plans for the church have been followed by the many architects after him, and more than 100 years later, the church is still not complete! There was still scaffolding draped around some of the towers and cranes visible in between.

The interior of the church was like another world. Bathed in the rainbow glow from the sunlight streaming through the stained-glass windows, I couldn’t resist the urge of just looking up forever at the ceiling, at the windows, at the tall columns. There was always something new to discover and enjoy. 

As one of the most visited sites in Barcelona, the waits to get in can be incredibly long.  I made sure to buy tickets online ahead of time to avoid the line. 

#### **Casa Batlo & Casa Mila**

The architect for both of these buildings was also Gaudi. They both stand out compared to the other buildings next to them. Gaudi was not known for making your expected cookie cutter buildings. I appreciated both of these buildings for their exterior beauty and didn’t have a chance to take the interior tour. 

#### **Park Guell**

Another one of Gaudi’s masterpieces with many colorful tiles. It’s a collection of unique buildings, gardens, and sculptures all inspired by the natural landscape of Spain. When I went, it just started to rain, and I had to duck behind the columns to avoid getting wet! I was so worried that that was going to be the end of my visit. But just as I was losing hope, the skies cleared up and the sun came out. All of sudden, there was a rainbow stretching across the sky, as if reflecting the colorful tiles decorating the whole park. 

The Casa Del Guarda is the home in the front of the park that was made for the gatekeeper. Now, the exhibit, Gaudí and Barcelona, expression of an urban ideal, is housed inside for tourists to visit.
Just like for the Sagrada Familia, I would suggest buying tickets ahead of time to avoid waiting in the long lines and guaranteeing getting in. 

#### **Las Ramblas**

It’s a street to walk down surrounded by tourists and Barcelona natives and soak in the sun filtering through the green canopy above. There were all sorts of restaurants, bars, souvenir shops, and more lining the street. At the end of Las Ramblas, there is La Playa Catalunya, one of the many beautiful beaches to line the northern end of Barcelona. 
The tall monument for Christopher Columbus. He is definitely a controversial figure in my opinion since his discovery led to the unfortunate death of many Native Americans by disease. 

#### **La Barceloneta**

This Spanish beach was incredible that I came back twice during my visit. Back home in Houston, the best thing I have to a beach is the muddy and quite sad looking beaches in Galveston. La Barceloneta was the exact opposite as blue, gorgeous, and so inviting. It was easy to see the influence of having such a nice beach so close to the city. 

#### **Museu de Nacional d’ Art de Catalunya**

On top of the highest point of Barcelona at Montjuic, this museum is one of the most visited places in the city. The view of Barcelona from up here is incredible as well. Again, I really spent my time taking in the awesome pathway to the museum and the view and didn’t have the time to go into the museum. However, the artwork inside is supposed to be reflective of the regions artists. 

#### **Magic Fountain of Montjuic**

Once it gets dark, the fountain in front of the Museu de Nacional d’ Art de Catalunya comes to life to give an amazing lights, music, and water show that puts the Bellagio water show in Las Vegas to shame! People were standing, lining every space around the fountain and the streets nearby. Eventually, we found our place in the middle of the street on a divider with a straight view down the middle. As we all waited in anticipation, the traffic around us never stopped. Cars, taxis, and buses were continually moving, and we had to be careful from accidentally stepping out onto the road.
