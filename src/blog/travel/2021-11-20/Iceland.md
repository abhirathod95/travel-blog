Abhi and I got married! For our honeymoon, we decided to go to Iceland for the dramatic landscapes on an eight day road trip for Thanksgiving break. 

Going in November had its pros and cons. Although we had more time at night to chase Northern lights, we had a hard time seeing them through dense cloud cover common at this time of year. We also had only 6 hours of daylight each day which meant we had to plan our itinerary efficiently. However, the best time to go is honestly whenever you can! Each season offers a very different experience so it depends on what you want to see and do. 

For this trip, Abhi and I decided not to do any tours this visit to Iceland, including the famed ice caves, because of the pandemic. Instead, we opted for hiking and driving our hearts out enjoying each others company. However, we are certainly planning a return trip in the future for everything we missed!

##### **Day 1: Exploring Reykjavik**

After a red eye flight into Keflavik International Airport, we drove to a cluster of small cabins in Sandgerdi called iStay cottages that reminded us of the Getaway cabin we stayed in near Austin to sleep and freshen up for a few hours before being on our way to Reykjavik.

Our first stop was at Braud & Co, a well known famous bakery close to Hallgrimskirkja. There was more than enough paid parking on the next street over to park nearby. We grabbed some hot coffee and several pastries to devour as our lunch before climbing to the top of the church for a small fee and snapping a classic pic of the city below.

Afterwards, we walked to Harpa Concert Hall which was only 15 minutes away. The path took us through a nice colorful street lined with souvenir shops to browse on the way for a quick stop to admire the exterior of the concert hall before heading back to the car to make our way to the Snaefellsnes Peninsula. Since it was our first day, we ended up stopping often to admire stunning vistas no matter where we looked.

##### **Day 2: Snaefellsnes Peninsula**

The benefit of visiting Iceland in November was getting to sleep in until 8 since sunrise doesn't happen until 10 AM. After a lazy morning and quick breakfast in Grundarfjörður, our first stop was Kirkjufellfoss to see one of the most photographed waterfall and mountain in Iceland. There is a small parking lot about 5 minutes from the waterfall.

The rest of our day included stops along the Snaefellsnes Peninsula such as Djúpalónsperlur, Saxhóll crater, as well as the towns, Hella and Arnarstapi. There's a beautiful hike between the two towns if you have time. Our last and final stop was at Budkirkja before heading to Reykjavik for our second hotel.

##### **Day 3: Golden Circle**

We were excited to start our first day on the Southern coast with a well known tourist attraction, the Golden Circle. Unfortunately, we also had terrible rain, blowing winds, and freezing temperatures that made the day less than ideal. We started with Thingvellir National Park and then made our way to Geysir before finishing at the powerful Gulfoss. By the time we reached Gulfoss, our toes were frozen and our waterproof jackets were soaking wet. We were so grateful for our crampons to keep us grounded on the ice to walk from the car to the railing and not flying off with the wind. I wished we had started with Gulfoss because it was the star of the entire circle.

While I'm glad I did the Golden Circle, I felt it was not as impressive as what was there to discover beyond it. If you have limited time and a car, I would strongly consider skipping the Golden Circle for another time and head further down the Ring Road. Other stops you may consider nearby are Hrunalaug Hot Springs, Kerid Crater, and Selfoss also located around this area.

Even though the weather was terrible all day, it slowed to a drizzle by the time we checked into our hotel. We decided to chase down a small patch of cloudless sky on the vedur.is, a local website with latest aurora forecasts, in hopes to see the Northern lights. This took us onto a pretty sketchy road. About 30 minutes into driving in the pitch black up a mountain with no side rails, the wind and rain started to pick up. The sky above was horribly cloudy. We decided to turn around after spooking ourselves several times turning each corner slowly. Its not always worth the hunt when the chances for lights are predicted to be abysmally low. 

&nbsp;

##### **Day 4: Chasing Waterfalls and More**

In Iceland, I ignored TLC and definitely went chasing waterfalls. Today, all we saw were waterfalls! We started with Skogafoss which was by far the most picturesque waterfall I had ever seen. Making our way to the top, we got a closer look at all the birds nestling in the side of the rock.

Afterwards, we made our way to Seljalandfoss and a nearby hidden waterfall called Glujafrabui. We got wet here from standing so close to the waterfalls! Before leaving the area, we tried some hot lamb soup at the stand which was hearty and refreshing in the cold weather. 

![](../../../images/Iceland/Iceland_12.jpg)

Finally, we had a clear sky and a predicted KPS of 3 for the night which meant Northern lights hunting. We got a glimpse of the magical Northern lights although it was rather faint. This was the best we got all week so we were glad to have caught it on our own at all. Also, a lot of the fun was the anticipation and working together to find the optimal location and time for the lights. If you're not planning to drive around in the middle of the night, most hotels also offer a wake up call when the Northern lights are occuring outside. Just be sure to let them know you'd like to be called when checking in.

##### **Day 5: Best of Southern Iceland**

The southern coast of Iceland is one of the most popular locations to visit, and it was easy to see why. We were treated with another clear day despite a forecast of rain. We made a last second decision to visit the wrecked plane site, Sólheimasandur, since the weather was great. The walk seemed longer than it really was since the ground was flat and we were constantly fighting the wind. Once we got to the site, the abandoned plane wreck contrasted against the black sand was very cool to see and made for some interesting photos. However, I would recommend skipping this if you are pressed for time. We spent about 3 hours here with only 20 minutes actually at the plane, and it meant we had to move more quickly at Dyrhólaey.

We enjoyed the viewpoints at Dyrhólaey more than we expected. Seeing the black sand beaches from above with waves crashing onto the shore was a sight to admire. The large sea arch was certainly the highlight of the area. In the summer, this can be a great location to spot puffins. On the other side of the viewpoint was the southern coast of Iceland stretching as far as the eye can see.

Then, we took a short 10 minute drive to reach the famous Black Sand Beach also known as Reynisfjara beach we were admiring from above. We were met with basalt columns creating a cool geometric backdrop to the powerful Atlantic ocean. We stayed far from the water in order to steer clear of those sneaker waves from dragging us out the sea.

Vik was a great town to stay nearby for a several days to use as a base. We were able to stock up on groceries at the Krona which was the grocery store we preferred over Bonus for snacks and quicks meals on the road. The iconic red roof church sits at the highest point of the town and has an amazing overlook of the town below. However, after two days of exploring here, we were moving on.

We ended the night spending an hour the hot tub under a clear sky full of stars after checking in at Fosshotel Glacier Lagoon before heading to the bar for some wintery cocktails. It's always a good idea to take an opportunity to enjoy a hot tub or hot spring in Iceland.

&nbsp;

##### **Day 6: Glaciers Galore**

The next morning, we woke up to a fresh blanket of snow outside. Our hotel looked so striking against the white. AS we were leaving, we found a small waterfall next to our hotel to explore.

```

We made our way to the famous Jökulsárlón and Diamond Beach which are right across from each other. It may have been the time of year, but we didn't get to see a fully studded beach like we were led to believe. The few icebergs floating in Jökulsárlón were colored in bright blue.

On our way to Hofn, we finally said hello to a group of young Icelandic horses who were very finicky and expecting treats. We pulled some grass from the ground to feed which they accepted gratefully at first and posed for some photos before they decided they were done. There are usually several spots along the Ring Road were you can stop to pet horses, but its always important to find a safe and marked spot for parking and being mindful of the fences around the farm.

We finally reached Hofn to fill up gas and see Vestrahorn from a distance before heading to our hotel. With more time, visiting Stokksnes beach is a popular spot for dramatic sceneries of the Iceland landscape.

##### **Day 7: Journey back to Reykjavik**

We started our last full day stopping for some Swiss mochas and Hjónabandssaela, a traditional pastry meaning marital bliss. Seeing as we were on our honeymoon, I felt it was appropriate. We decided to turn into Skaftafell Park to visit another well known waterfall called Svartifoss. As we got closer to the waterfall, the path got really icy. I almost slipped with no railing on the side. Neither of us felt comfortable moving forward at that point so we said hello from a distance and turned back. Lesson is always carry your crampons with you. 

On the other side of the park, there was a flat hiking path that we decided to do instead which took us close to a glacier. However, I would highly recommend considering booking a guided tour to walk on a glacier if you an extra day in the area.

Our last stop was at Fjaðrárgljúfur canyon before stopping at our hotel. The winding river below and the moss covered canyon truly makes it feel like a fairytale. Previous pathways to to the edge have been closed off now to preserve the vegetation of the region, and there are metal platforms to provide a great view of the waterfall and river below.

We spent the night right outside Selfoss, a city about an hour away from Reykjavik and a great starting point for the Golden Circle. After a long day of hiking and driving in the frigid cold, we found a highly rated Mediterranean restaurant that I can no longer find unfortunately located in the main part of town decorated with Christmas lights. 

&nbsp;

##### **Day 8: Land of Fire and Ice**

Even though we were bummed waking up on our last day without seeing more dramatic Northern lights, we were also ready to get back to our lives and see our pets again. We woke up pretty early in order to drive back to Reykjavik to get Covid tested before heading to Fagradallsfjall volcano only 30 minutes away from Keflavik airport. It was known as a "tourist eruption" after becoming active on March 19, 2021, but the eruption was officially declared finished in September 2021. There are several hiking options of different lengths that can fit each individuals preferences. We still had to get to the airport by 2:30 PM so we opted to do Path C which goes to the lava field but not the actual crater.  It's important to also check the local websites to be sure that the danger of the poisonous gases constantly being released is not too high.

Finally, we stopped at Gardur Lighthouse as our last stop to complete our roadtrip. At night, this would have been a great spot for some Northern lights! As we got back in the car to head to the airport, we promised we would be back again to experience the aurora and complete the Ring Road by heading North.

Until next time, Iceland!
