The Slea Head Drive is one of the best road trip to take while in Ireland and can easily rival the more famous Ring of Kerry. We drove into the area to stay in a cute bed and breakfast near Dingle the night before and spent the evening going to some of the bars in town. With the hearty Irish breakfast the next morning, we were ready to start our drive. The narrow roads hugging the Irish coast offers beautiful views of the ocean and some of the famous nearby islands, such as Blasket Islands. 

There are several stops on the way to feed sheep, rams, and horses for small fees which help support the local sheepherders in the area. Each sheepherder can have up to 250 sheep that they herd. There are even a few places to stop along the way to also watch a sheep herding demonstration. Unfortunately, there weren't any when we were there.

The ancient beehive formation, also known as cloch√°ns, are seen dotting the hills. The architecture was adopted to protect the people from the heavy winds.

The most rewarding aspect of the drive is the endless views of the sparkling blue water next to the rolling green hills while driving the winding roads.

If you have a bit more time in the area, then consider including a drive through Connor's Pass or spending some time in Dingle, trying some of the best ice cream I have ever had at Murphy's.
