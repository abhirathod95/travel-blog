In the middle of second year of residency and a new job for Abhi, we were able to get a five day getway to Los Cabos to celebrate our first anniversary. The sunny skies without a cloud in sight and sparkling sapphire blue ocean welcomed us into Los Cabos from the sky. Even with the early start at 3:30 am for the red eye, we were excited to have a luxurious relaxing week focused on us without any responsibilities.

We decided to book an all inclusive resort in the tourist corridor between San Jose del Cabo and Cabo San Lucas. With many articles reporting how touristy Cabo San Lucas can be, we found the location of our resort to be perfect for exploring both areas without much hassle. We did book a shuttle with the resort for transportation to and from the airport but otherwise we used Uber to travel during the week. Compared to my recent trip to Mexico City, the prices in Los Cabos were significantly higher by double if not triple, so definitely plan with that in mind.

##### **LE BLANC RESORT**

Most of our time was spent on the grounds of Le Blanc which had everything we could have wanted for our romantic getaway. The modern decor was beautiful, and the design was overall well thought out. With seven high end restaurants, all day cafe, and unlimited snacks at the pool, we were able to try different cuisines every meal and then go to the bar to relax afterwards at night with live music. There was nothing left to do but disconnect from the world a bit.

There were several pools to lounge in with a taco stand, swim up bar, and churros available every day. We booked a couples massage at the spa, a much needed relaxation, and also got to do the hydrotherapy circuit which was a new experience for me. Service is amazing here from everyone, and we would definitely recommend staying here when you visit Los Cabos.

&nbsp;

##### **CABO SAN LUCAS**

The town is filled with tourists walking around kitschy souvenir shops, bars, and other small stores. Some of the highlights to hit include the Baja Brewing Company, The Office, and Taller 17. Medrano Beach is easily accessible and is one of the main beaches available to swim in unlike most other beaches in Cabo. However, the beach can get very busy with all the tourists staying nearby. If you are looking for a party, then this is where you need to stay.  

&nbsp;


##### **EL ARCO DE CABO SAN LUCAS**

The main attraction of Cabo is certainly the famous sea arch. There are many different ways to tour this area that can be set up either through the hotel or on your own. We chose Envatours which boasts a completely transparent boat to enjoy the sea life swimming by underneath. With a one hour boat ride out to the arch which is only 10 minutes from the marina, we were able to enjoy a slow ride with the sea breeze and warm sun. There were sea lions sun bathing in the marina and out near the arch, and we could occasionally hear their roars as well. However, paddle boarding, kayaking, and snorkeling around here may just be a better way to see this attraction for a more memorable experience.

On the way to the arch, we also passed by Lovers Beach and Divorce Beach which are connected but facing two different sides of the sea - one side calm and the other more rough. Some tours will include a short stop at the beach on the way to the arch. Otherwise, multiple companies offer water taxis leaving from Medrano Beach to visit both beaches at your own leisure and will let you know when the last boat back will be.

##### **MOUNT SOLMAR HIKE**

This hike was a much anticipated experience but unfortunately, the owner had closed for two weeks for baby rattlesnake season. It takes you to an amazing birds eye view of the marina and partial view of the arches as well. The best part of the hike is that you are accompanied by several friendly dogs to usher you up the mountain. The hike is daily starting at 8:15 am every morning at the Dog Training Camp in Cabo San Lucas and is about two hours in total. This experience was cautioned as being strenuous by multiple sources. For updates on whether the hike is happening, check out their facebook page called Ascenso al Cerro del Vig√≠a. The hike is free but tips are appreciated by the owner!

##### **FLORA FARMS**

The sustainable eco-friendly farm to table restaurant, bar, and shopping center is a must do in Cabo. They offer colorful cooking classes with ingredients sourced directly from the grounds. Starting with a short tour, we then jumped right into cooking outside under umbrellas with our Farmaritas. Our class of 12 was taught simple but delicious recipes for an entire meal including tomatillo salsa, veggie tacos, tortillas, and key lime pie. We enjoyed a beautiful lunch together outside among the greenery and warm sun.

If you are not interested in the cooking class, the restauarant and bar is also a great way to experience the farm with a well curated menu of healthy and delicious organic meals to enjoy with a group of friends or significant other. Reservations can be made through the website and is recommended. Come hungry!

&nbsp;

##### **SAN JOSE DEL CABO**

The more quiet and historic half of Los Cabos, San Jose del Cabo was my preferred spot of the two. Its not too far from Flora Farms to pair these two together in one day. The colorful streets of the town are nice to walk while trying to decide on a place to stop for lunch. If you are hungry, consider stopping at La Lupita and Los Tamarindos which come highly recommended.

Every Thursday evening between November and June, the town hosts an art walk to visit multiple galleries with local artists' works which is another fun way to experience the town. In order to get here, just navigate to Plaza Mijares and start walking from there.

&nbsp;


##### **SEA OF CORTEZ**

Walking the beach every evening was one of the highlights of our trip. As alluring as it looked to enter, most beaches are considered unswimmable in Los Cabos due to the strong waves and currents. Between November and May, the whale sharks return to the warm water for feeding and offers a one of a kind experience to see them in their natural habitat. There are several tours that offer day trips to swim with the whale sharks in La Paz but Cabo Trek and Baja Expeditions have been mentioned to be good options to do this ethically and safely for the creatures. While we were too early to do this tour, we still would recommend this experience to those who are able to visit during those months of the year.

*****

Los Cabos is a great place for a couples getaway. I recommend at least a four day trip to Los Cabos for a relaxing vacation. There are other places to also visit such as Todos Santos, Fox Canyon, La Paz, and Cabo Pulmo National Park if you have more time on the peninsula. However, these are the highlights not to miss while you are here!
