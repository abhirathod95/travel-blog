When planning my trip to Ireland, I knew I wanted to see the Giant's Causeway, an interesting geological formation of naturally formed hexagon shaped rocks. The myth behind the structure is that a giant named Finn MacCool was challenged to a fight with a Scottish giant and built the causeway to travel to Scotland. There is a similar geological location with hexagonal columns in Scotland which is thought to have been part of the causeway.

Northern Ireland may just seem like more of Ireland to visitors, but it's technically a part of UK, which introduces some interesting issues between the two countries that share a rather large border. During our two hour drive from Belfast to Giant's Causeway, we tuned into the radio to learn a little more about the news in this country.

We made it to Giant's Causeway just as the visitor center opened at 9 AM. However, to park at the visitor center, we were asked to pay 13 euros per person. This price seemed a little too steep for us so we looked up some other options for parking.

> The best place we found to park at the Giant's Causeway is at The Nook, provided you buy breakfast, lunch, or just coffee with them. The location was right next to the entrance from the visitor center and so convenient.

We arrived early enough that there weren't many people around yet. We chose the Blue trail to hike which is one of the easier ones and quickest ways to get to the Giant's Causeway, but there are several other trails that are along the cliff for more scenic views. The blue trail still had some great views though.

> There is a shuttle that runs too and from Giant's Causeway from the Visitor Center that costs 1 euro per person per trip.

After the short hike and breakfast at the Giant's Causeway, we went to the **Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge** attraction that was 20 minutes away. I would recommend buying tickets (9 euros/person) before hand to avoid any disappointment about crossing the bridge. Even though it is a sturdy rope bridge now, it used to only have one rope to hold onto for fisherman to carry their catch across. While crossing the bridge was a fun touristy activity to take part in, the views from the other side of the bridge was incredible.

Finally, we decided to end our day in Northern Ireland by visiting **Dunluce Castle**. The castle ruins were by far one of my favorites during my trip. We explored every nook and cranny of the ruins with no one else there. I wasn't able to make it inside every castle I visited, but I was glad to have entered Dunluce Castle since it is situated a beautiful location right on the cliff and has an interesting history.
