Bangkok, Thailand is an exciting place with lots of spicy tastes, colorful sights, and sometimes fishy smells. There's something for everyone to enjoy, and most of the time its rather unexpected what you find. And it doesn't cost as much as it might in some other countries. My visit was hectic, bright, and jam-packed, just how I like it.

### **What to Do**

##### **Grand Palace, Wat Pho, etc**

For the history buffs of the group, visiting the luxuriously built temples in Bangkok is a must. 

For those interested in seeing more temples that are not as popular, try going to **Wat Benchambophit, Wat Samphran, and Wat Saket** as well. 

##### **Wat Arun**

To get from Wat Pho to Wat Arun, there a short 5 minute ferry for 4 baht/person. 

##### **Floating Market**

I visited the **Taling Chan Floating Market** which was only a 20 minute drive away from my hotel in the center of Bangkok. You don't get to actually sit in a boat that travels through the river but you get to see how the market is conducted and try the different foods they sell. There is an hour boat tour that takes you through the nearby canals to see how people live and stops at a small shrine to visit. I would try sitting towards the front of the boat if you want to avoid getting water sprayed on you at times. There is also an outdoor market thats not on the water to also try street food that seemed to have a more local crowd than tourists. 

There were several reasons why I chose to visit Taling Chan over the more famous and larger floating market, **Damnoen Saduak**. Frankly, the decision against Damnoen Saduak was time to get there and cost. The drive to Damnoen Saduak is about 1.5 hours from Bangkok, which means 3 hours of my limited time in Bangkok would have to go into travel. Once there, negotiating a decent price for a boat to visit the floating market might be difficult. On top of all of this, visitors said that the market was incredibly commercialized. The pros for going to Damnoen Saduak is that its the most famous market for a reason. Also, on the way to the market, you can make a stop at the famous train market where the Thai sellers move their shop off of the train tracks when the train passes through. 

##### **Shopping** 

For the shoppers in the group, Bangkok was one of the best places to shop at for affordable prices. I'm gonna share my favorite places to shop while in Bangkok!

ICONSIAM. One of the most modern shopping malls I have ever seen. The bottom floor celebrates the Thai culture with locals selling street food, souvenirs, clothes, and more. The interior decoration is inspired by classic Thai architecture that you'll all around Bangkok. The rest of the mall has a great selection of stores including high end stores like Louis Vuitton and Chanel. It's a great place to spend a few hours when it gets too hot outside. Outside the mall, there is a water show at specific times in the evening to watch with the Chao Praya river in the background. 

PATPONG NIGHT MARKET. For all the cheap knockoffs and random souvenirs you could possibly want, Patpong night market is the place to come. I bought the cutest pair of loose Thai pants that you'll see everyone wearing here. There are some seedy appearing bars running along the night market, so whether thats something you are or aren't interested in, here's a heads up. 

CHATUCHAK WEEKEND MARKET. My favorite place for shopping in all of Bangkok. Suprisingly, this market was not talked about more when I was doing research before visiting. But if you like shopping for nice things on a budget, definitely plan on having lots of cash and time to explore this market. There were quality items for super reasonable prices, but it can depend on which section of the market you are in. I also got a 30 minute foot and shoulder massage for a great price in between shops!

##### **Lhong 1919**

For the hipsters in the group, Lhong 1919 is a bit of a low-key place for tourists to visit. It is an old Chinese mansion that has been renovated to house small boutiques and art galleries with a shrine in the middle dedicated to the goddess, Mezu. Throughout the mansion, there are little plaques to teall you more about the Chinese immigrants that had initially built the mansion back in 1919. There are several creative murals to find scattered throughout the complex. It's a nice way to wind down a long day of exploring. 

##### **Sky Bar/Rooftop Bar**

For the party people, Bangkok is one of the best cities to get out and paint the town red at night. The famous Sky Bar was featured in the film, ____. However, there are rooftop bars all around the city with great views of the city lights at night. Another important location is Khao San Road which goes through a great transformation from a street food and shopping location during the day and party central at night. 

One of the more touristy things to do in Bangkok is to find a rooftop bar with the view of Wat Arun to see lit up in the evening. If this is something you would like to do, then make a reservation the day before or even earlier to avoid any disappointment. 

##### **Ayutthaya** 

Ayutthaya is a popular day trip for tourists from Bangkok to visit old ruins similar to those in Angkor Wat. We decided against doing this day trip for time sake and because we were headed to Angkor Wat in a few days. However, this is a great day trip to get vist some ancient historical sites away from the modern hustle bustle of Bangkok. 

##### **Chao Praya River Cruise** 

I always say that river cruises are best to do on the first day for an introduction to the city. 

*************
### **Where to Eat**

Eat anywhere and everywhere you find street food, and try a little bit of everything. We definitely found things we loved like coconut ice cream, Pad thai, sticky rice,  and things we were not so impressed with as well. We didn't eat in restaurants as much as we did street food, so have a look in my other article for more details!

### **Transportation** 

I used the Grab app for most of my travel in Bangkok due to convenience and cost. The other pro for using the app was that they took credit card. However, there are certain places such as around ICONSIAM where it can get pretty congested in the evenings where you may need to flag down a taxi if you aren't able to get a Grab. It was about $4-6 dollars to travel anywhere within the city. However, there is also public transportation

### **Where I Stayed**

One of the benefits of visiting Thailand is that nicer hotels can be a little bit more affordable if you have a mid-tier travel budget. I got to stay at two amazing hotels. One with an extensive breakfast buffet and the other with an infinity pool with views of the Bangkok skyline to die for.
