Recently named one of the fifty most beautiful destinations in the world in Conde Nast Traveler, Valle de Cocora was a must do during my visit to Colombia. The park is located right outside Salento, a town part of the famous coffee triangle where the best beans are produced. The famous wax palm trees, known to be the tallest in the world, rise about 60 feet into the air, so be prepared to feel tiny compared to them. We decided to hike the valley and had a blast even though there were some moments we struggled with the uphill climb and the rain! Here's everything you need to know to be prepared for hiking Valle de Cocora.

#### **How to get to Salento and the Valle de Cocora.**

In order to reach Salento, there are usually two main options: bus and plane. We decided to fly given the limited days we had in the country and flew with Latam out of Medellin. This was a relatively affordable option for us with tickets costing less the $50 per person. I highly recommend choosing to fly over taking the bus given the convenience of travel and the safety it offers. If you do decide to fly, there are two nearby airports in Armenia or Pereira and will need to arrange transportation either through your hotel or AirBnb or call an Uber to take you into Salento. We paid USD $90 each way for transportation of 9 people. The bus on the other hand is a lot more affordable but takes at least 6-7 hours depending on where you leave from. There are buses from both Bogota and Medellin.

Once in Salento, the town was small enough to walk around without needing additional transportation. To get to Valle de Cocora, there was a row of vintage Willy jeeps in the main town square that were ready to drive us to the starting point of the hike anytime starting at 6 AM. This costed $8000 pesos per person (cash only) for a round trip. The jeep does not leave until there are 10 people to take, 3 of whom are required to stand hanging off the back of the jeep. Abhi ended up having to do this, and he actually preferred it to sitting inside the jeep. Looking back, I wish I had done it too! The ride took about 25 minutes so enjoy the fresh air and initial views of the luscious greenery of the coffee region around you. When returning back to Salento, the jeeps were waiting right where they dropped us off and usually stay there until 5 pm in the afternoon.

#### **What to Pack.**

For this hike, I recommend proper hiking attire with a reliable rain jacket and hiking boots to navigate the rain and muddy terrain. I also preferred a wicking t-shirt and full leg covering to protect from bugs as well. Given the unpredictable rainy weather, I would keep a dry bag for your valuables and at least a water resistent backpack. Also plan to pack water or a water bottle with a built in filter straw to fill up anywhere. Strong bug repellent with atleast 40% DEET was recommended by travel clinics, and most of us also took antimalarial prophylaxis prior to the trip to protect us from mosquito bites. Finally, sunscreen is a must even though the sun was never too strong with the thick mist that took over half way through the hike. You will also need a total of $15000 pesos cash per person to give at two different stopping points for access into the park.

There aren't many stops for food along the way so most hikers will take a packed lunch bag from any of the town restaurants for a picnic stop at any of the stunning viewpoints along the way. We simply bought some snacks at the local grocery store in the town square for pick me ups along the way.

If you are like us and need to check out before leaving for the hike, there is a convenient place to store your luggage while you hike located right next to the famous Jesus Martin Cafe. A kind faced local lady will meet you at the door ushering you into her home where you may be welcomed by a friendly calico and other town dogs and cats. It costed us $10000 pesos to store 6 carry on size bags which she covered up with black trash bags to keep hidden. Of course, this is not the most secure way to store your things, so I would highly recommend taking your valuables with you in dry bag while you hike.

#### **The Hike.**

Once you've been dropped off at the starting point of the hike, there are a few options on how to see the famous trees. The first option is the main path straight ahead which takes you to the trees first. The second option is to do the hike counterclockwise starting through the blue gate. This is the harder option but leaves the main attraction for the end. If you are short on time, you can also just start off with the straight path to the highest point which would include all the main miradors or viewpoints of the valley and turn around. This should only take about 2.5 hours with time for stops and avoids the harder part of the hike through the jungle. If you are planning to do the complete loop, I would budget about 5-6 hours in total to have enough time to make stops and hopefully also include a visit to the hummingbird farm.

In terms of fitness, a person needs to be of good fitness level to complete the entire loop given the length, significant uphill climb, and dexterity of navigating the path through the forest. That being said, I think the short option can easily be completed by most individuals who are able to walk on a uneven well marked road for about 1.5 hours and then back the same way.

We decided to do the counterclockwise hike with the Valle de Cocora at the end. Looking back, we probably would have preferred the clockwise direction which has the easier uphill climb on a pretty well paved road. The direction we took started through the farmlands where we had to actively dodge horse and cow poop followed by 6 rickety bridges with large gaps over a river, and finally a steady uphill muddy climb in the cloud forest for about 2.5 hours before you reach the top. We were not able to stop after completing the 6 bridges due to time restriction, but there was a fork in the road to visit the hummingbird farm called Acaime La Casa de Los Colibris, an extra 0.5 km hike to and back to get back on the original trail. At the top, we were met with a misty cool view of a mountain ahead of us to celebrate the end of the hard part of the hike before starting our downhill walk into the valley. As you can probably imagine, we were mostly wet with jelly legs and mud crusted shoes by this point and ready to see what we had actually come here for.

Initially, the mist was strong and made it difficult to see anything in the valley and even in front of us. It felt ethereal. We happened upon our first mirador with ghostly images of the many palm trees in front of us. As we walked down, the mist began to clear up to finally give us a chance to see what we had come here for.

The Willy jeeps were waiting for us where they dropped us off for a quick ride back to the town. We got one last look of the valley and tall trees before having to leave for the airport to our next stop in Santa Marta.

#### **Salento.**

The town of Salento itself is also beautiful to explore, and I wish we had stayed here for longer. The town was slow and sleepy in the morning with only a few stores open at 8AM during the middle of the week. However, the town is known to get very busy during the weekends with many visitors. Right outside our Airbnb, aptly called El Encanto, there was an amazing view of the valley below.

For things to do here, activities include visiting a finca to see how coffee is made, taking a horse ride, or bicycling down a neighboring valley for a different experience in seeing the palm trees. For meals, visit the Jesus Martin Cafe which is known for its coffee and good food but there are certainly many other restaurants that are frequently visited by tourists.

The Calle Real is the main street of the town and on it, you can find souvenir shops, boutiques, and other small shops to explore in the latter half of the day. The bright colors of the town and friendly stray dogs and cats, and kind locals certainly made this one of my favorite stops in Colombia.
