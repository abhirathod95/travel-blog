If you just decided to visit Colombia, good choice! Just a short plane ride away the US is a country that has amazing coffee (although primarily exported out), incredible graffiti art, and beautiful biodiverse environments. From the evergreen cityscape of Medellin to the sunny beaches of Cartagena, there's a lot to see and do in each part of the country. We flew into Bogota and out of Cartagena and took several internal flights to maximize our time in Colombia. Here's our itinerary of Colombia hitting most of the highlights of the country!

### <center> **THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE YOU GO**

>DATA. Consider obtaining the Claro SIM card when you land in the airport. The store is open 24 hours and located right before the exit. We got the 10 GB available for 7 days costing 30000 pesos. There are stores available all over the country to refill the card whenever needed. Just look for the Claro sign outside the store.   
>MONEY. You are going to need a lot of cash for most of the country. Most tickets, vendors, and restaurants asked for cash and did not have the capabilities for card. Always ask before sitting down at a restaurant if you are hoping to use your card. We got cleaned out at a restaurant that did not take card and had to hunt down an ATM afterwards. Tips are expected after meals. If you plan on taking taxis instead of Uber, then you will need cash.    
>TRANSPORTATION. For local transportation, Ubers are your friend. They are technically "illegal" but everyone uses them anyways. You just need someone sitting in the front seat. They are also going to be significantly cheaper than a taxi since they have a fixed rate. If you are staying in a non-touristy area, it may take a while to get an Uber. Hotels and airbnbs can sometimes arrange transportation for you from the airport to the hotel. For domestic travel, internal flights were really reliable to getting between different cities. We used Avianca and Latam. During our research, we came across multiple reviews that Avianca is the most reliable airline. All of the other airlines were considered less reliable with delays, overbookings, and cancellations. However, we luckily did not have any issues with our flights. Masks were required at all airports and on the plane when we were there. Please check any COVID-19 requirements prior to booking travel to and within the country.    
>SAFETY. Colombia has become a popular tourist destination over that past years. While the country is safer than before, it is still important to follow common safety practices. Don’t bring any expensive jewelry or laptops if its not necessary. Keep your camera consciously nad put it away when you are not planning to take pictures. Don’t stay out after dark and always take an Uber over walking. While one area might be safer, just a few streets down may feel more dodgy.  
>LANGUAGE. Brush up on your Spanish because almost everyone you meet will not speak any English. Also have a translator app with the Spanish dictionary downloaded to safe you when your Spanish only takes you so far.    
>WATER. In most areas of the country, the water is safe to drink from the tap.  
>ELECTRONICS. Plugs are compatible with US electronics.    
>VACCINES. Talk to your doctor and/or travel clinic at least two months in advance to your trip. Hepatitis A/B and yellow fever vaccines were recommended to me prior to travel as well as oral prophylaxis for malaria depending on which areas of Colombia you are visiting.

### <center> **Day 1: Bogota**

##### **Mercado Paloquemao** 

![](../../../images/Colombia/Colombia_47.jpg)

We started with an amazing tour with Victor at Mercado Paloquemao trying thirty different fruits from across the variety of regions in Colombia. This was a three hour experience hosted through Airbnb that was by far one of our favorite experiences in Bogota. We tried unique fruits and vegetables that were incredibly sour to super sweet, and it was amazing to try so many fruits and some vegetables we had never even heard of. You will need a lot of room in your stomach to try all of them and may possibly feel a little sick with all the mixing tastes. However, it was totally worth it! 

##### **Plaza De Bolivar & Candeleria District**

![](../../../images/Colombia/Colombia_43.jpg)

Only a ten minutes ride from the market was the main plaza of the Canderleria district. As we walked to the square, there were multiple vendors selling souvenirs such as bags and earrings to browse. At the main square, the Primary Cathedral of Bogota was the main highlight of the square and open to walk around quietly as locals and tourists sat offering prayers. Since we had been warned by several locals to not spend too much time in the square during election weekend, we quickly toured the inside before heading to the museums. Other highlights of the Candeleria district are stopping in La Puerta Falsa for some delicious arepas, visiting the striped Santuario Nuestra Señora del Carmen, or taking a graffitti tour.

##### **Museo de Botero & Museo de Oro**

Just a short walk from the Plaza is Museo de Botero, a free museum showacasing the artwork of Botero. Botero is one of the most famous artist of Colombia, and you will see his artwork displayed pretty much everywhere throughout the country. Afterwards, just a short walk away is Museo de Oro with many gold artifacts saved throughout the years. The wall of gold artifacts is a highlight of the museum on the fourth floor.

##### **Monserrate Cable Car**

![](../../../images/Colombia/Colombia_40.jpg)

The best view of the city is at the top of Montserrate at sunset. You can reach the top of the mountain either through cable car or funicular, but cable car is highly recommended for the views. During the weekends, the cable car can get really busy so its better to go on the weekdays if possible. Unfortunately, it started pouring during our time at the top but it was still a pretty magical view with the cloudy cover when the rain stopped. 

##### **Andres de Carne Res** 

A highly recommended experience when visiting Bogota is to visit the original location of this restaurant in Chia located about 45 minutes from the Candeleria district. However, there is another location within the city with a similar vibe which we went to for dinner. While we did have fun here, there were several aspects of our experience that made us finally decide that the restaurant wasn't for us. The menu was more than 40 pages long but not friendly to vegetarians or those of us who only eat chicken. Also, we waited alomst an hour after ordering to finally get food on the table. However, I will also say that we didn't get to visit the original location and also there were no alcoholic beverages that weekend due to the election which made our visit very different than described by others.

##### **Salt Cathedral**
The Salt Cathedral in Zipaquira is an underground church built in a salt mine and a really interesting piece of architecture. Unfortunately, I was not able to go on this tour because I got sick after eating at Andres de Carne Res. Booking a tour with an English guide to see this attraction is the easiest way to visit without having to find transportation. The location is about 2 hours away from the city, and the tour there takes you through the different rooms of the cathedral with the final main room at the end with an amazing light show. Other day trips to consider pairing with the Salt Cathedral include Villa de Levya, a colonial town with nice cobblestone streets, or Lake Guatavita, also known as the possible location for the El Dorado gold despite unsuccessful ventures to locate it.

##### **Explore Coffee Shops**
![](../../../images/Colombia/Colombia_46.jpg)

If you decided to come back to Bogota after the Salt Cathdral, I would recommend visiting some of the other cool neighborhoods of Bogota such as Chapinero or Usaquén. Colombia is known for their coffee but actually the country itself does not keep most of the premium coffee beans for themselves. However, that is slowly changing as the country is beginning to really develop a coffee scene. Other menu items to try at a cafe include the hot chocolate with cheese and the chocolates.

##### **Play Tejo**
A great way to end the day would be to play a unique game called Tejo involving throwing rocks, exploding paper, and clay targets. Be sure to check out Tejo Turmequé or Tejo La Embajada and make a reservation in advance. Unfortunately, we missed out on this experience because of the dry law on voting days and were not able to find another time later on in our trip.

### <center> **Day 3: Medellin**

After landing in the late morning, we had a half day in the City of Eternal Spring named after its year long temperate weather. The airport was about 40 minutes outside the city and gave us a chance to travel through the longest tunnel called Santa Elena. With only half a day to see Medellin, there were a few highlights we could not miss.

##### **Communa 13**

![](../../../images/Colombia/Colombia_42.jpg)

The come-uppance of this incredible community is a story to hear and see. The unique incorporation of outdoor escalators and significance of graffitti art was explained to us during our tour with Diana who lived in the community.

##### **Botero Plaza**

Closer to the city center is the Botero Plaza, yet another celebration of the artist, Botero, this time focused on sculptures. He was known to initially make sculptures early in his career and then transitioned to paintings later on.

##### **Night out in El Poblado**

One of the nicer neighborhoods in the city, there are many nice hotels to stay in and rooftop bars to visit. The Charlee Hotel rooftop bar is one of the well known stops to either begin or end if you go bar hopping.

### <center> **Day 4: GUATAPE**

##### **Climb Piedra El Penol**

![](../../../images/Colombia/Colombia_21.jpg)

A must do day trip from Medellin is to Piedra El Penol, the largest rock in South America. Located only two hours away, Piedra El Penol has more than 700 steps scaling the side of the mountain to reach the top for an incredible view of the man-made lake around it. 


##### **Guatape**

![](../../../images/Colombia/Colombia_20.jpg)

The nearby town of Guatape grabs your attention with its vibrant colors and friendly people. While climbing to the top of the rock was entertaining, our visit to this town was certainly the highlight of our day and only 10 minutes away. There are many different restaurants to pick from to stop here for lunch before walking around. Behind the main square, you will find the bright Plaza Zocalo and alley with hanging umbrellas for some great pictures!

### <center> **Day 5: Salento**

We landed the night prior in Salento and stayed in a cute Airbnb called El Encanto. The owner was able to arrange transportation for us from the airport in Pereira for a one hour drive. Since this was the countryside, don't be surprised to find more bugs than usual and bring warm pajamas for a cold night without a heater if you are here outside of the summer season. 

##### **Hike Valle De Cocora**

![](../../../images/Colombia/Colombia_10.jpg)

One of the best days during my visit to Colombia was hiking the complete loop of Valle de Cocora. The full hike takes about 4-6 hours to complete and brings you up close and personal with the national plant of Colombia, the wax palm trees. We flew to this part of the country particularly for this experience. Some of us hiked and others bicycled down a neighboring valley. Either way, this was a great day for all of us and was worth the detour to the famous coffee region.

![](../../../images/Colombia/Colombia_12.jpg)

If you have more time in this area, there is a lot to experience in the coffee region such as visiting a coffee plantation called a finca, horse riding, and more. The town of Salento itself is also a charming place to explore more leisurely if you have time. However, we flew out of Pereira after completing our hike for a relaxing evening in Santa Marta in our Airbnb's rooftop pool.

&nbsp;

### <center> **Day 6: Minca**

Minca is located only 40 minutes away from Santa Marta with yet another diverse ecosystem. It's a small place with hiking trails and swimming spots to spend your day in the Colombian jungle. While in Minca, transportation is either by foot or on motor bikes - no cars or taxis will take you further than the main town center.

##### **Swim in Pozo Azul**

![](../../../images/Colombia/Colombia_30.jpg)

We got dropped off near the cafe at the entrance of Pozo Azul and opted for the 15 minutes walk. A stray dog happened to show us the way and led us all the way to the waterfall, earning him some treats at the end. You can also ask the moto-taxi to take you all the way as well. The first waterfall is a good spot for swimming and enjoying the cool water with the jungle foliage all around you. The second higher waterfall is a great spot for cliff diving and usually less crowded. If you are interested in exploring more waterfalls, check out Marinka Falls. 

##### **Visit Finca La Victoria**

A classic experience in Colombia is to see where the infamous coffee beans come from and how they are harvested. For a small price, we were able to try two cups of coffee and join a short 40 minute tour to see the coffee harvesting process from start to finish.


##### **Other things to do**

Tayrona beach is a famous national park for pristine beaches and amazing hikes through the jungle. Unfortunately, we were unable to visit since the park was closed for cleansing by the local tribes in early June. 

If you are more adventurous than we are and have more time in the country, I would highly consider the 4 or 5 day hike to the Lost City, ancient ruins that are not as well known as Machu Pichu in Peru but perhaps just as incredible to visit. During our research, we learned this was considered one of the hardest hikes to ever complete which made us decide not to do it. 

&nbsp;

### <center> **Day 7: Rosario Islands**

![](../../../images/Colombia/Colombia_31.jpg)

After a week of exploring and learning more about the country, today was all about relaxation! We rented a boat from GetYourGuide for a full day to explore the different islands making up Rosario Islands. There was one skipper and one crew member with us who organized the entire day's itinerary and took us to the best areas including snorkling spots. The islands we stopped at were Isla Baru, Playa Baru, and a few other sopts we never figured out the name for. For lunch, we stopped at a beach club to enjoy the beach breeze with mojitos and coconut rice. There was a nice beach to relax in for an hour before getting back on the boat. For our last stop, we asked the captain to anchor in the middle of the ocean for some of us to do backflips off the boat before setting sail back. 

Once we had sufficiently repleted our vitamin D, we spent the evening bar hopping in one of the hottest cities to party. The most recommended bar by far was Alquimico by several people throughout our trip. The two story bar has a cool vibe and some strong drinks to start off the night but all the bars were impressive each with a unique theme and matching drink list. The best way to get there is with an Uber but it may take some time for the car to navigate in and out of the area.

```

We spent our last full day in Colombia exploring the old walled city of Cartagena on the colonial streets lined with colorful buildings covered in plants and horse drawn carriages waiting in the front. There are several interesting spots to visit such as the Sanctuary of Saint Peter Claver, the clock tower, the gold museum and the palace of the inquisition. There are several free walking tours you can join to learn more about the history of the area. If you're looking for a place to souvenir shop there are several vendors on the streets and shops to explore. The one must do is watching the sun set on the beach near the famous Cafe del Mar. We weren't able to get into the cafe on the time due to the extreme popularity. Instead, we bought some ice cream from a street vendor and watched along the walls on the side with other tourists and locals alike. It was a nice end to our last day in Colombia.

### <center> **Day 9: Cartagena**

We spent our morning coordinating out ride to the airport and getting our Covid test. Testing was available at the airport for 140000 pesos per person with results available in one hour. 

I hope you enjoyed reading about our experience in Colombia and a reasonable itinerary to see a huge part of the country in one week!
