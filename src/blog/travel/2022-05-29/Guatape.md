A popular day trip from Medellin is to visit Piedra El Penol, also known as the largest rock in South America, and the nearby colorful town of Guatape. Since we had two days in Medellin, we definitely wanted to conquer this rock. The drive to El Penol is about two hours. We chartered a comfortable size nine seated van that was perfect for our group and gave us the freedom to explore the sites at our own pace while hanging out with one another on transit. There is also a public bus from Terminal Norte which can also be a convenient option and much more affordable. The easiest option would be to book a tour group that usually pick you up directly from your hotel or central location with everything arranged including entry to the rock, lunch, and all transportation. The chartered bus was most convenient for us and costed $350 in total. After sight-seeing, the van dropped us off at the airport for our night flight to Pereira for our next adventure in Valle de Cocora.

After two hours of driving in the green countryside, we reached Piedra El Penol. On the path up to the rock, there were several restaurants, souvenir shops, and even a place to book a helicopter ride around the lakes. The admission cost to climb to the top is about 20000 pesos per person cash only. There are about 700 steps organized into multiple switch backs up the side of the rock. While this seemed daunting, the entire climb to the top took about 20 minutes with many, many stops.

Once we reached the top, this amazing view was available 360 degrees. These lakes are actually man made and appeared to expand far into the distance. There were restrooms and a little shops selling souvenirs, beverages including beers, and popsicles to cool off with. If you have more time in the area, there are many water activities available ike jet skiing, guided boat tour, paddleboarding, and more.

The climb down was a lot quicker and very similar to the climb up. The next part was my favorite part of the day which was to visit the charming town of Guatape. On our way to Guatape, we were able to stop and take this classic picture of the rock from a distance.

As we walked into the town, the first thing to notice are all the colors. As we explored more of the town, the more colorful areas we would discover. There are many good restaurants around the town square to explore for lunch. The two vegan restaurants came highly recommended by several people. The main building in the square was the bright white and red church.

After a stop to enjoy the quiet inside the church, head behind the church to find the famous umbrella street. The smell of fresh cinnabon buns drew us in further until we came to the most colorful area of the town, Plaza Zocalo. Here, we spent time just relaxing on the steps. Some of us explored some of the stores and boutiques nearby or enjoyed a cup of coffee.
