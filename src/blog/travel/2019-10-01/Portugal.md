Lisbon is a beautiful European town to visit during the winter months. While the rest of Europe is experiencing the wintery cold and snow, Lisbon weather is sunny, breezy, and just perfect for exploring. Between the colorful tiled walls and orange rooftops, the smell of salty water and fresh seafood, and the sound of musicians of all kinds wherever you go, Lisbon is simply amazing.

We stumbled across the <span style="color:red">**Convento do Carmo**</span> after seeing the Elevador de Santa Justa, and I highly recommend entering. The ceiling of the convent has fallen and left a direct view out to the sky. The entrance fee was only 4 euros, and we pretty much had the whole place for ourselves.

If you ever come across a sign pointing towards a Miradouro in the **Alfama district**, take the time to follow it. The path usually will lead you to an impressive lookout of the hilly city. My favorite was **Miradoura de Santa Luzia** right at sunset. A band was playing jazz music to fill the air as the sun reflected rays off of the orange rooftops so characteristic of Lisbon. The moment was just so classic of a European vacation. Nearby, there's a well known wine spot called Porto do Sol which is great place to order a bottle and watch the sun set. There's also a famous drink called **ginza** sold all over the Alfama district to try!

Jeronimos Monestery, Belem Tower, and the Monument of Discoveries are all really close to one another, so we visted all three in one day! This had to be my favorite day because we ended the day eating the famous Pasteis de Belem!

The **Belem Tower** has to be the most famous structure near Lisbon, and it's easy to see why. The retired watch tower is striking sitting in the water at any time of day. However, I would recommend not visiting the inside of the tower if you are short pressed on time. While the exterior is stunning, the interior is not as interesting. Situated just less than a mile away is the **Monument of Discoveries** with Vasco de Gama at the forefront.

**Rossio Square** was the centerpoint that we passed through several times while walking, but also a great place to do some souvenir shopping, grap a meal, and take a break from exploring. During the night, a small Christmas market was even set up offering much needed hot wine and roasted chestnuts.

**Time Out Market** is a great place to eat. The market can seem a bit touristy, but the food is actually really good. The moment you enter, the busy atmosphere and smell of good food is enough to make you eager to eat. One of the benefit of eating here is that you're not restricted to one kind of cuisine and are able to pick and choose what dishes you would like from more than fifteen restaurants. The **codfish** is known to be one of the most famous dishes in Portugal, and a cab driver told us they even have a cookbook titled "1000 ways to cook Codfish." The Time Out Market is a great place to try some of the different ways the Portuguese cook codfish. My family and I truly loved the codfish and cream dish, so be sure to try it!

##<center>**Day Trip to Sintra**</center>

Sintra is always a highly recommended day trip from Lisbon because of the romantic mystical architecture of the many palaces and parks, Pena palace being the most famous. Check out my post **A Day in Sintra** for more information!

### **Places to Visit:** Quinta de Regalaira, Pena Palace, Town Center

##<center>**Where I Stayed**</center>

I stayed in an apartment with **Hello Lisbon** right on the famous Pink Street. While this meant I had to hear faint discotech music every night even on the fifth floor, I really felt like I was a local Portuguese living in Lisbon. We even made breakfast everyday using the fully equipped kitchen with groceries we had bought on the first day from a local store. 

The location of the apartment was also ideal for sightseeing with many of the important spots within walking range, such as Praca do Commercio, Time Out Market, and Elevador Santa Justa! 

##<center>**Tips & Tricks**</center>

- If you're wondering what souvenirs to take home, I would recommend colorful tiles or the famous packaged **salted sardines**. 

- Best place to get a picture of the yellow **Tram 28** or to even ride it back to Praca do Commericio is right near Miradoura de Santa Luzia!

- If you're too tired to walk, take a **tuk tuk** to your next destination.
