New Zealand is truly a wondrous place to enjoy nature to the fullest. We visited during New Zealand summer time so the lupines and lavendar farms were everywhere. The scale of the waterfalls and mountains are unbelievable that I always felt like I had been transported back into the prehistoric times and was about encounter a dinosaur at any moment. These pictures are only some of the highlights of our 8 day roadtrip through both the North and South islands of New Zealand.
