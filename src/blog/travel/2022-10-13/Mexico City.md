My mom and I went away on a quick long weekend getaway to Mexico City in September with pleasant weather and thankfully no rain. We were surprised by the sheer number of activities we could do while we were here. We loved our girls trip to Mexico City only two hours away and spent time catching up, eating good food, and visiting the sights.

### <center> **Things to Know Before You Go**


>TRANSPORTATION. The best and easiest way to travel around the city was to use Uber. There is also a public bus system that is reliable if you are trying to travel on a budget.     
>MONEY. Every restaurant and activity was able to accomodate credit card. For the small booths and especially for street tacos, you should carry cash. We exchanged about 50 dollars into pesos for a three day trip and had a lot left over.  
>DATA. Most unlimited data plans in the US covers usage in Mexico which was really convenient. Otherwise, you can buy a SIM card in the airport which is our favorite way to get data when we travel.    
>ELECTRONICS. Outlets are the same as in the US, so adapters and converters are not necessary unless you are visiting from another country.  
>SAFETY. As two female travelers, we never felt unsafe in the city during the day or at night. We did not explore the night scene past 9:30 pm so I can't comment much about it. As always, practice common sense.  
>TIPS. Restaurants usually expect about 10% tip. Otherwise tipping with small change for anyone who provides good or extra service would be appreciated.  
>LANGUAGE. Most locals did not speak much English so it is important to brush up on some Spanish or have the downloaded dictionary on your phone to communicate. We use the Google Translate app all the time. Luckily my broken high school Spanish was sufficient to get by.  
>SITE SEEING. Many places such as museums are closed on Sunday so keep that in mind when planning your itinerary.

### <center> **Things to Do**	

&nbsp;

##### **VISIT MUSEUMS IN CHAPULTEPAC PARK**

The first stop to make while in Mexico City is the Anthropology Museum. The well curated two story museum is large enough to occupy at least half a day. One of the best exhibits is located in the building directly across from the entrance and is a large hall filled with artifacts. All of the descriptions are in Spanish so it can be helpful to get a guide to take you through the museum if you are interested in really understanding all the exhibits.

Loacted in the same park, the Chapultepac Castle is found in the top of the hill about a 25 minute walk from the Anthropology museum. The outside grounds are pretty impressive to walk around but the real highlight is the beautiful hallway of stained glass windows.

&nbsp;

##### **WALK AROUND CENTRO HISTORICO**

The city really comes to life around Zocalo, the main city square! While we were there, the square was decorated with the colors of the Mexican flag and had bleachers set up for the celebration of the anniversary for the Battle of Chapultepac. The Metropolitan Cathedral and the National Palace line two sides of the plaza. Just around the corner of the cathedral, there were concheros or Aztec dancers that were performing because we were visiting during the special event. If you have some time before lunch, visit the nearby Templo Mayor for ruins in the middle of a city.

Walk down the Avenue 5 to come across the famous blue tile building called the House of Tiles or Casa de Azulejos which is an amazing photo op. Its only a 15 minute walk from Zocalo. On the way, there are little stops and interesting museums worth exploring. Other places close by to visit includes the decorative Museo Postal, Alameda Central Park, or Museo Nacional de Arte.

```

Finally, you end at one of the best attractions to see and tour which is the Palacio de Bella Artes, a theater for the performing arts. For a relaxing break with a great view of the building, visit the Don Porfirio cafe on the 8th floor across the street in the Sears building. There may be a little bit of a wait but its totally worth it!

##### **RIDE A BOAT IN XOCHIMILCO**

A classic experience in Mexico City is riding down the canals of Xochimilco in colorful boats called trajineras while enjoying food and drinks surrounded by mariachi music. The travel time from the city center is about 1 hour with all the traffic included as well so it is important to set aside at least half a day to fully complete the experience.

The negotiation of price can get tricky here. Even our Uber driver warned us in Spanish to not get taken for a ride without confirming pricing first as he was driving us to Embarcadero Nuevo Nativitas, the best entrance for the area. Since the two of us did not plan to do the boat ride, we didn't have to navigate this, but reported prices on other sites were approximately 350 pesos to charter your own boat. Instead, we opted to walk the canals to admire the colorful trajineras and nearby markets with ample opportunities to buy affordable souvenirs for friends and family. 

&nbsp;

##### **EXPLORE ROMA NORTE & CONDESA**

```
I was pleasantly surprised with how green Mexico City was! There were times when I was walking down the street and felt like I was in a jungle taking over a block of apartment complexes. Avenida √Åmsterdam is one of those well traversed jungle walkway that goes around Condesa and includes the Parque Mexico that everyone in this area uses for walking, running, biking, and everything else in between. The other surprise was the number of adopted dogs we saw - it seemed like every other person was walking their dogs in the evenings especially on this walkway.

&nbsp;

##### **COYOACAN**  
This was the one neighborhood we were not able to visit this time. The famous blue museum dedicated to Frida Kahlo is here and pretty much always sold out of tickets if you don't buy them beforehand by at least two weeks. Unfortunately, the website is not extremely reliable to buy them from the USA so I would ask if your hotel can arrange to buy them for you. Otherwise, trying to book a tour through any travel website will at least guarantee you a ticket although prices are higher. Other places to visit include Mercado Coyoacan which is a great place to stop for food.

&nbsp;

##### **TEOTIHUACAN PYRAMIDS**

![](../../../images/Mexico/Mexico_City/Mexico_1.jpg)  

One of the best half day trips I have taken, visiting Teotihuacan pyramids is highly recommended and a great chance to ride a hot air balloon over ancient ruins. We went with the company, Volare, and the experience was well curated and convenient including transportation and food. Definitely check out my other article going through our entire visit for more information!

### <center> **Places to Eat**	

Mexico City is one of the best places to eat so be sure to bring your appetite. I've compliled a list of restaurants, bakeries, and coffee shops to try while in town. However, some of the best eats will be street tacos, so consider taking a taco food tour with a guide to make sure to try all the best spots.

We stayed in Casa Decu which was highly recommended by several other travel blogs. The location was extremely convenient only 20-30 minutes away from the airport and in the Condesa neighborhood. There was always a doorman to answer the front door when you ring the doorbell for guest safety. There wasn't any air conditioning or built in heater but in September, we didn't really need it. The design is clean and modern with all the amenities you need. Our favorite aspect though was the rooftop area where they serve an included continental breakfast and caffeine fixes throughout the day. As with the rest of the city, there are so many different plants thriving here that it feels like a nice oasis.
