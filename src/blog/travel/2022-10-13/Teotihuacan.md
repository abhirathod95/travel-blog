Just less than one hour away from Mexico City is an incredible experience to see ancient ruins from a different viewpoint than usual. The Teotihuacán ruins are made up of the Pyramid of the Sun, the third largest pyramid in the world, and the Pyramid of the Moon connected by the Avenue of the Dead. Called the "birthplace of the gods," it was first excavated in the 1800s but dates back to 400 BC! From a hot air balloon, it was possible to see most of the grounds from an aerial viewpoint.

This was my first time riding in a hot air balloon, and the experience of doing so to see Teotihuacán was amazing. Our tour was booked through Viator with Volare, and everything was effortlessly done. Let me take you through the timeline of our day to plan your next visit!

##### **5:30 AM**

We woke up bright and early at 5:00 am to be ready for pickup by 5:55 am. The van was waiting outside promptly. As we were driving in the dark, the city was barely waking up with quiet streets much different from the packed traffic by noon. Our time in the city so far had been amazing exploring the different food scenes, museums, and landmarks during the 3 and half days we were there. The Anthropology Museum is a highly recommended visit while in Mexico City and provides a lot of information about the ruins if you have a chance to visit it before.

##### **7:00 AM**
We reached the Volare building in 50 minutes. With a quick waiver signing, we were free to grab some coffee, take a bio break, and watch the crew determine if the weather was safe to fly. Every couple of minutes, they would release balloons into the air to watch how they travel to help them decide. In the meantime, we watched the sun rise casting a red glow on the pyramids in the distance, making us even more anxious for the actual experience.

&nbsp;


##### **7:45 AM**
The crew deemed we were ready to fly even though it was a little more windy than preferred. Within 30 minutes all the hot air balloons were inflated with baskets filled with passengers ready for take off. There were baskets with 8 people or 16 people and balloons of all designs. The take off was smooth although important to keep your hands safely inside the basket until you are past tree height. The warmth from the fire was enough to keep it comfortable in a light denim jacket and long pants.

As we flew past the pyramids, it was impressive to the see the magnitude of the Pyramid of the Sun and in the distance, the Pyramid of the Moon as well from the air. Further along, we were flying over small fields of some crops and fields of yellow flowers before spotting our clear landing spot about 3 miles from the ruins.

##### **8:45 AM**

We had a soft landing in a field south of the pyramids. Per French tradition, our group toasted with a small glass of pink moscato to celebrate a successful hot air balloon flight before getting out of the basket and into a van heading back to the Volare offices for breakfast with some much needed coffee.

##### **9:00 AM**

With the cheerful music of a live Mariachi band playing, we enjoyed our chilaquiles and hot coffee in the Mexican sun. Some people opted to head back to the city after the balloon ride, but most of us were waiting for 10 am to head to the ruins. If you're looking for some extra energy at this point, there were shots of mezcal available to take that the friendly band members were handing out.

##### **10:00 AM**

The vans were loaded with all the visitors headed to the ruins and on our way. The first stop as we entered was the Pyramid of the Moon which is the second largest pyramid in Mesoamerica after the Pyramid of the Sun. Its located at the end of the Avenue of the Dead where ceremonial parades would end to be used for human and animal sacrifices. As you walk the Avenue of the Dead, there are smaller compounds lining the side, some of which can be climbed for a different view. Just next to pyramid, you can visit the Palace of Quetzalpapalotl and the stone carving of Quetzalcóatl, a replica of which is also in the Anthropology Museum. Be sure to bring sunglasses and wide brimmed hat and use sunscreen liberally for protection from the strong sun since cover is limited here.

The Pyramid of the Sun is the largest pyramid in Mesoamerica, even taller than the world wonder, Chichen Itza, also located in Mexico. The ancient city of Teotihuacán is believed to be one of the largest cities during those times, but much about it is still unknown. Prior to the pandemic, it was possible to climb to the top of the pyramid but that has been not allowed since. However, the view across the pyramid form the bottom is just as impressive to admire the hard work and planning it must have taken to build such a tall structure without any modern equipment.

##### **12:00 PM**

We left the pyramid grounds and headed to the famous restaurant, La Gruta, just a ten minute walk away to get some food and respite from the sun. The menu boasts using local ingredients for pre-Hispanic cuisine. With a light lunch since we didn't particularly enjoy the vegetarian options, we really enjoyed the atmosphere created with the rainbow colored chairs contrasting the gray coolness of the cave.

##### **1:20 PM**

We met back in the spot we were dropped off at and were assigned to a van that would take us directly to our hotel. With one last chance for some fresh fruit and cold Coke, we hung around with some new friends talking about our experiences until our names were called. A large van was ready to take us directly back to our respective hotels which was included in the total cost as well. While the trip to the pyramids was rather quick, the traffic in Mexico City had picked up by the afternoon, so expect about a 2-2.5 hour trip back depending on where you are staying.

A visit to Teotihuacán pyramids is a must if you are in Mexico City. This was an awesome experience and only required a half day to see the pyramids. After a quick nap once we reached our hotel, we were ready to explore another part of the city in the afternoon!
