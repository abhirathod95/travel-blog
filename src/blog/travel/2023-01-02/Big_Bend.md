Even though Abhi and I have been living in Texas for more than 15 years, neither of us had ever taken a trip out to West Texas to visit Big Bend National Park, and we have clearly been missing out. We only had one full day in Big Bend, but it has easily become one of our favorite national parks we've seen in the US. And we can't wait to go back! The small town of Marfa is only two hours away and an interesting day trip to tag on while in West Texas. Not to mention that its also close to the McDonald Observatory for the most premium way to look at stars.

#### <center> **BIG BEND NATIONAL PARK**


>WHEN TO GO. December/January was a great time to visit given the mild temperatures and were still able to hike in a light t-shirt alone. Spring and fall would also be ideal to visit during. I would avoid the summer season when temperatures are soaring and storms/flooding are more likely to occur.   
>THE MOON. Be sure to check what phase the moon is going to be while you are visiting. This will determine how many stars and whether the Milky Way may be visible to the naked eye. Unfortunately, we went around the full moon which made stargazing and astrophotography very difficult.  Try to plan a visit during the new moon for the best views at night.  
>FOOD.  There is one restaurant in Big Bend near the Chisos Basin Visitor Center. I would recommend packing a lunch and snacks to take with you to stop on the way since the trip to this visitor center is usually out of the way to other sites.   
>BEAR & COYOTE COUNTRY. Always be mindful when hiking or eating outside in this area. If you do come across a bear or coyote, do not run and try to make yourself as big and loud as possible to scare them away. Ask the park ranger for more tips before heading out.  
>TRAVEL. If driving in from a major city in Texas, it will take between 7-9 hours to reach Terlingua. We were not able to take our electric car since there are not many established chargers in West Texas but might be more feasible with a Tesla since they have a more extensive charging network if planned very carefully. To fly, the closest major airport would be in El Paso which is about a 2.5 hour drive from the park. A car is required to explore this area.

##### **ROSS MAXWELL SCENIC DRIVE**

![](../../../images/United&#32;States&#32;of&#32;America/Texas/Big&#32;Bend_Marfa/Big_Bend_0.jpg)

This 30 mile drive is a must while in Big Bend National Park, and you can take as long as as little as you would like to explore. It takes you through the best vistas of Big Bend and ends at the Santa Elana Canyon where you see the canyon that is split by the Mexican and American border. The best stops we liked along the way were the Ward Springs Trail, Mule Ears Trail, Lower Burro Mesa Pouroff, and best for last, Sotol Vista, a great place to end for the sunset.

We started our drive at noon and were still exploring until 5pm. You have to drive back on the same road but watching the colors of the sunset on the mountains around us on the way back was our most memorable time in Big Bend.

Here's a list of popular hikes in Big Bend that come highly recommended by visitors and park rangers alike. I would say that four full days in the park would be enough time to complete all of these hikes with time for the Ross Maxwell drive as well. For a one day itinerary, it is recommended to do the Lost Mine Trail, Window View Trail, and the Ross Maxwell Drive with the Santa Elena Canyon hike to hit all the main highlights of Big Bend. 

1. Santa Elena Canyon Trail // 1.7 mile roundtrip, easy-moderate. Be prepared for a switchbacks and a few steep inclines if there is river flooding.
2. Lost Mine Trail // 4.8 miles roundtrip, moderate. Starts with an easy hike before opening up to amazing views at the top.
3. Balanced Rock Trail // 2.0 miles roundtrip, easy-moderate. There are some vertical rock scrambles at the end to get to the final spot. Drive to the parking lot is 6 miles of unpaved road and takes some careful maneuvering. 
4. Window Trail // 5.2 miles roundtrip, hard.
5. Window View Trail // 0.4 miles roundtrip, easy. Paved sidewalk and easily accessible from the Chisos Basin Visitor Center
6. Boquillas Canyon Trail // 1.2 miles roundtrip, easy.
7. Wards Spring Trail // 2.4 miles roundtrip, easy. Our favorite low key hike with no one else with us, amazing around sunset.
8. Mules Ear Spring Trail // 3.9 miles rountrip, moderate.

##### **MCDONALD OBSERVATORY STAR PARTY** 

Every Tuesday and Friday, the [McDonald Observatory](https://mcdonaldobservatory.org/) hosts a star party where visitors can come to learn about the stars and planets and view them through telescopes. Its a great experience for children and adults alike. We all gathered outside in our warmest clothes and fleece blankets to handle the wintery wind blowing at night to peer up the sky with our guide helping us navigate. Unfortunately, we had a near full moon to contend with the star light that we weren't able to see the extent of stars that are normally visible to the naked eye. On a particularly dark night, its possible to get a clear view of the Milky Way anywhere in this area. We were able to see Saturn, Jupiter, and Pleides star cluster through the telescope to name a few. The center is also open during the day to visitors who can't make it to the star parties. The observatory is located closer to Marfa so its easier to pair this with a day in Marfa. However, even if you're not planning to visit Marfa, I would still highly recommend this experience while visiting Big Bend and making the ~ 2 hour trip one way from Terlingua.

&nbsp;

##### **TERLINGUA**

The dusty town of Terlingua sits right outside Big Bend National and State Parks. This is the easiest area to find a place to stay unless you have booked the limited accomodations found inside the park. We booked a cool secluded Airbnb considered "off the grid" and great for star viewing with a telescope and chairs provided to enjoy. The energy is given through solar panels right next to the property and water from collected rainwater over the year.

After a long day of hiking, consider stopping by the famed Starlite Theatre that was given a new roof and converted into a restaurant. The food was alright for us but the margaritas were some of the best I have ever had in Texas. They were taking reservations which would have been a great idea to avoid the 2 hour wait we ended up committing to since all places generally close by 9 pm out here. If you're here while there still some daylight, explore Terlingua Ghost town which used to be a mining town before it was pretty much abandoned in the 1930s.

#### <center> **MARFA**

While in West Texas, its worth taking a detour to the artsy town of Marfa for one day. This eclectic town has risen in fame due to Donald Judd, a contemporary artist from New York who was looking for a town to extablish permanent displays of art and founded the Chinati Foundation. Be sure to be in town anytime between Thursday to Saturday when places are open to visitors and closed for the remainder of the week. Here's an example of a perfect slow day in Marfa that hits all the highlights!

```

Start the day with coffee from FRAMA, The Sentinel, or Do Your Thing Coffee to wake up for a day of slow exploring. Then head over to Marfa Burrito, frequented by Matthew McConaughey while in town, for a large breakfast burrito with simple ingredients but big taste. This place is cash only!

Then explore the town and the local shops such as Se Vende, Wrong store?, The Get Go, Marfa Brand Soap Factory, Raba Marfa, and Ranch Candy no further than 5 minutes away from each other. 

For lunch, consider Food Shark if it is open or our favorite, Para Llevar, for some wood fire pizza that really hit the spot.

Then, head over to the Chinati Foundation to explore the art scene by taking the [Selections tour](https://chinati.org/visit-chinati/tours/) to see some of Judd's and other artists' art installations in a repurposed military barracks. You will get to walk among the 100 aluminum blocks with no two alike and also visit Robert Irvin's Dawn to Dusk installation which were two of my favorites. No photos are allowed on the tour but come 20 minutes earlier than the tour to walk among the concrete blocks set up outside the visitor center for some pictures.

After the tour, set out to see Prada Marfa in the middle of the desert around twilight. This famed store is filled with all right footed heels and bottomless purses to deter thieves and is a great spot for some cool photos. Right at the outskirts of town on the way, the old Stardust Motel sign will come up that occasionally still gets lit up on special days.

Now that you have developed an appetite, head back into town for dinner at somewhere like El Cochineal or Waterstop.

Once its nice and dark outside, drive a short ten miles out of town to see the Marfa Mystery Lights. Perhaps you may see something we didn't, but we're convinced the lights are simply the headlights or taillights of the cars driving by.
